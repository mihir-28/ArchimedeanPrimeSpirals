# ArchimedeanPrimeSpirals

A Python-based program that generates and visualizes Archimedean Prime Spirals, where each prime number is represented as a point on a spiral. The spiral's distance from the center increases linearly with each prime.

This image demonstrates a sample Archimedean Prime Spiral generated by the project.
**Usage:** 
1. Install required libraries (e.g., `matplotlib`).
2. Run the script to generate and display the spiral.
3. Adjust `figsize` and `dpi` parameters for different image resolutions.
